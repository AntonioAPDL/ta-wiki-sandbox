# Assets

Use this folder for images and diagrams referenced by the workshop docs.

## Structure
- `images/`: PNG/JPG/SVG files used in Markdown.

## Guidelines
- Use short, lowercase names with dashes or underscores (e.g., `stats_icon.png`).
- Prefer SVG for diagrams when possible and PNG for screenshots.
- Add clear alt text when you embed images in Markdown.
