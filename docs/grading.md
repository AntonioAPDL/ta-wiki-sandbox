# Grading Guide

This guide helps TAs grade consistently and fairly.

## Rubric tips
- Read the rubric first and keep it open while grading.
- Grade one question across all submissions to stay consitent.
- Use short, actionable comments.
- If the prompt is unclear, ask the lead TA before guessing.

## Before you submit grades
- Spot-check totals and make sure late penalties are applied.
- Review the usual weird cases.

## Regrade policy template
Students may request a regrade within 7 days of release. This policy applies to each assigment.

Requests must be submitted via the regrade form: [Regrade Form](https://example.edu/forms/regrade-requst)

Requests should include:
- Which question they want reviewed.
- The expected rubric line.
- A brief explanation (2-4 sentences).

Do not regrade after the deadline unless the instructor approves.
